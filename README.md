# ML Zoomcamp — Exercises & Projects

This repository contains exercises, notebooks, and small projects from the ML Zoomcamp course. It's intended as a personal workspace for experimenting with datasets, models, and practical ML tooling.

If this repo is a fork or a workspace for a course, keep personal notes and solutions under `notebooks/` and reusable code under `src/`.

## Contents
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks (exploration, experiments, lessons)
- `data/` — dataset snapshots and preprocessing artifacts (often git-ignored)
- `src/` — scripts and modules for training, evaluation, and utilities
- `models/` — trained model artifacts, saved checkpoints
- `reports/` — plots, result summaries, and exported figures

Adjust the above to match the actual layout of this repository.

## Quickstart

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aksb15/ML_Zoomcamp.git
cd ML_Zoomcamp
```

2. (Recommended) Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install dependencies (if `requirements.txt` exists):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If there's no `requirements.txt`, install only what you need, for example:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Running Notebooks

Start JupyterLab and open notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Tip: Use `%pip install -r requirements.txt` inside notebooks to ensure the kernel has the same environment.

## Typical workflows

- Exploratory data analysis: work in `notebooks/`, commit only cleaned notebooks and results.
- Training: use scripts or small modules in `src/` and save trained artifacts to `models/`.
- Evaluation: add evaluation scripts that load models from `models/` and output metrics/plots to `reports/`.

Example training command (replace with your project's real entrypoint):

```bash
python src/train.py --config config/train.yaml
```

Example evaluation command:

```bash
python src/evaluate.py --model models/latest.joblib --data data/test.csv
```

## Data

Large datasets should not be committed. Use the following patterns:

- Add `data/` to `.gitignore` and keep small sample data in `data/sample/`.
- Provide scripts to download or recreate datasets, e.g. `scripts/download_data.sh`.

## Tests

If you add code under `src/`, include unit tests under `tests/` and run them with `pytest`.

```bash
pip install pytest
pytest -q
```

## CI / Badges

Add CI (GitHub Actions) workflows under `.github/workflows/` for linting, testing, and building artifacts. Add badges to this README after the workflow is configured.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Open a pull request with a clear description of changes

Follow the prefered style for code (type hints, linting) used in the repo.

## License

If you want an open-source license, add a `LICENSE` file (e.g., MIT, Apache-2.0) and reference it here.

If you'd like, I can also:
- Add a `requirements.txt` from the project's imports
- Create a `LICENSE` file (MIT or Apache-2.0)
- Add a simple GitHub Actions CI workflow that runs tests and lints

Tell me which of these you'd like next and I'll implement it.
